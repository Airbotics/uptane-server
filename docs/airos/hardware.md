## Supporting your hardware
To support your own boards you will need to add any Yocto Board Support Packages (BSPs) to your `build/conf/bb.layers.conf`.

You will also have to ensure your board is on our list of officially supported boards.

As of now we have support for:

- Raspberry Pi 3
- Raspberry Pi 4

Coming soon:

- Rockpi 4B

If your board is not there please take out an issue and we will try and add support as quickly as we can.

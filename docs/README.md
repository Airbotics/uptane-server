# Welcome to Airbotics

Airbotics is an secure, robust, [open-source](https://github.com/Airbotics/airbotics) software deployment platform for robotics built on [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) and [OSTree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/).

You can start deploying software with the [Airbotics Cloud](https://dashboard.airbotics.io) version or learn how to [self-host](guides/self-hosting.md) on your existing infrastructure.

> We're in Closed Beta so this may still contain bugs.
